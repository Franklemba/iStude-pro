           <h3>what makes this site special?</h3>
           <p>The main importance of this site is to make life easier for students, it has come to our knowledge that most students
               don't usually perform well because they have no idea of how their lectures prepare papers. Recent studies have shown that 
               most lecturers repeat same questions from previous past papers, hence going through there past papers puts you ahead of the game.
               Well worry no more because <b>iStude</b> will help you get there.
